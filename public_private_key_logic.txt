Only passphrase name is CASE SENSITIVE and not Public key name.

So, if for first key we create with the public key name "staffbank" and passphrase "secret".
And for next key we create Public key name "STAFFBANK" and passphrase "SECRET".

For GPG, both public key names "staffbank" and "STAFFBANK" are same only.
But it will consider the passphrase of the key which got created first.

So, if we encrypt a file with publickey "STAFFBANK".
GPG can decrypt that file using passphrase "secret" and not "SECRET" as later was created after the first key.


So, always give different names while creating keys.
